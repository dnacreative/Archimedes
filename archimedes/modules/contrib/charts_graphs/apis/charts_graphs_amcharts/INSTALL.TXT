You need to download amCharts files from: 
http://www.amcharts.com/download

Unfortunately amCharts ships as several zips, so you need to download each one
from the above path:

* Column & Bar (e.g. amcolumn_x.x.x.x.zip)
* Line & Area (e.g. amline_x.x.x.x.zip)
* Pie & Donut (e.g. ampie_x.x.x.x.zip)

and within each of these zips you will find the following files:

* amcolumn.swf (in the amcolumn directory of the amcolumn zip)
* amline.swf (in the amline directory of the amline zip)
* ampie.swf (in the ampie directory of the ampie zip)

Download and place them in the downloaded folder of the Drupal Charts and Graphs
module, directly, without any folder structure inside the downloaded folder
(e.g. into sites/all/modules/charts_graphs/apis/charts_graphs_amcharts/downloaded)

Sorry for the inconvenience, but there's really nothing we
can do about it due to licenses restrictions and Drupal policy
to not ship anything non-GPL with the module code.

CAUTION: Do NOT assume you don't need swfobject.js since
charts_graphs already requires swfobject Drupal module. Unfortunately,
the versions of the two js files are different, so you can
not re-use swfobject from the module file for amCharts the way
you can re-use it for OFC2
